# Code of Conduct for WordPress Development Projects

## Our Pledge

We, as maintainers and contributors of the WiseSync plugin and PaperSync theme projects, pledge to make participation in our projects and communities a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community that aligns with the values of the broader WordPress community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language in code, documentation, and communications
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences in discussions
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community and end users
* Showing empathy towards other community members and project users
* Helping and mentoring new contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment in any form
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Making discriminatory jokes and language
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing any of our projects or communities. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct.sync@shubkb.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident and will maintain appropriate confidentiality.
