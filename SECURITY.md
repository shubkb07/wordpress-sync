- All third-party plugins and themes

Security updates will be clearly marked in changelogs and receive version bumps according to semantic versioning.

## Third-Party Libraries

We regularly audit and update third-party dependencies. Our development process includes:

- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Verifying the reputation of library sources
- Minimizing dependency scope and permissions
- Keeping dependencies updated to secure versions

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices and ask that security researchers do the same. We commit to:

- Acknowledging reports promptly
- Validating and responding to legitimate reports
- Addressing confirmed vulnerabilities
- Providing appropriate credit to researchers

Thank you for helping keep our WordPress projects secure!
